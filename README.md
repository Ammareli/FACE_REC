# This is My project.
# Face Recognition via Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning algorithms for face recognition using the Dlib library. It utilizes the Dlib frontal face detector for accurate face detection and the Dlib feature extractor to extract 128 distinctive facial features. These features are then stored in a database, allowing for the identification of faces by computing the Euclidean distance between their feature vectors. The project is designed to focus on accuracy and efficiency in recognizing faces in various conditions.

## Key Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Dlib's frontal face detector to detect faces in images accurately.
- **Feature Extraction**: Employs Dlib's feature extractor to obtain 128 unique features from each detected face.
- **Face Recognition**: Implements a recognition system by comparing facial features using the Euclidean distance, enabling the identification of individuals.
- **User Interface**: Features a user-friendly interface built with Kivy, allowing easy application interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Dlib**: For face detection and feature extraction to compare face vectors.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing and additional computer vision tasks.
- **Kivy**: For creating a responsive and functional frontend.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install dlib
pip install opencv-python
pip install kivy
```
